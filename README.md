# 🏦 AllLife Bank - Personal Loan Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning project developed for **AllLife Bank**, a U.S.-based financial institution, to help identify potential customers likely to purchase personal loans. 
The goal is to support the bank’s marketing department in targeting existing deposit (liability) customers and improve the conversion rate of future loan campaigns.

## 📌 Project Objective

AllLife Bank currently has a growing liability customer base (depositors), but a relatively small number of asset customers (borrowers). The bank aims to:

- Convert more liability customers into personal loan customers
- Retain them as depositors while cross-selling loans
- Increase loan uptake through targeted marketing

This project builds a **predictive model** (Binanary classification - Decision trees) to identify customers with a high likelihood of purchasing a personal loan.
